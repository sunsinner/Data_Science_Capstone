# Data_Science_Capstone
Files from the Data Science Capstone course on Coursera, offered by Johns Hopkins university

This is a repository containing files and source code of the capstone project for the Coursera Data Science Specialization.
Source code can be obtained from the "app.rar" file, and the "pred_model_presentation.rmd" file gives a short explanation on how the shiny app works.
